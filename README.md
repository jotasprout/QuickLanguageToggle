# Quick Language Toggle

Quick way to switch between English and Spanish keyboards on an Android phone.

There are quick ways to switch between languages using the International keyboard feature in both MacOS and Windows but I haven't yet found a quick way to toggle on my Android phone.

I am now on a quest to create one.
